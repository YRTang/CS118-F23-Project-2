Please concisely describe your congestion control scheme here.
No need to be verbose, brief descriptions/bullet points are preferred.

Points to notice:
1. Client-proxy-server:
    6001 -> 5002 -> 6002
    6002 -> 5001 -> 6001
2. Packts can be lost or reordered
3. Max packet size is 1200 Bytes
4. Question: may only use UDP socket??
5. Fix timeout should be sufficient
6. Two options to implement RDT: Go-Back-N or Selective Repeat
