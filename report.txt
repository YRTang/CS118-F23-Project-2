Please concisely describe your congestion control scheme here.
No need to be verbose, brief descriptions/bullet points are preferred.

sequence number range is [0:packet_num-1]
ack number range is [1:packet_num]
Handshake ACK from client is set to 1 to indicate correct establishment, and it has nothing to do with following data's seq_num.

The initial window size is 1, and it cannot be modified.

We basically use AIMO combined with the slow start and fast recovery as our congestion control scheme.

If an ACK is successfully received by the client, we increase the cwnd by 1 and the cwnd will not larger than ssthresh
if current status is slow start.

If the number of duplicate packets is equal to three in the client site, we will use fast retransmit to resend the loss
packet, and our congestion control strategy status will change to fast recovery, the ssthresh is set to cwnd/2 and the
cwnd is set to ssthresh+3. For every duplicate ACK received in the fast recovery status, the cwnd will increase by 1
but it will not larger than the BUFFER_SIZE. Once the client receives new ACK, congestion control status will go back to
slow start and reset all variables related to fast recovery

For timeout, our congestion control scheme will set ssthresh to cwnd/2 and cwnd to 1 and retransmit the timeout packet


Some notices:
1. ssthresh is optimized to be 5 (most effective)
2. Payload size is set to be 1180
3. SYN_NUM is used for handshake establishment, and it can be set to any number (currently 1)
3. No limit on maximum buffer size with queue implementation
4. Fix timeout to end TCP communication should be sufficient (1~2sec)
